    <p class="Introductionwithshi">Hi I'm John Lludd Lacaden, 19 yrs old and I live in QC</p>
    <p class="Introductionwithshi">    I am in a relationship and my hobbies are playing
              basketball or video games with my friends</p>
              <p class="spaced-text"> </p>
              <p class="Introductionwithshi">My favourite meal is Adobong Manok and 
              my favourite snacks are pizza,sour gummies,fruits,and some more fast foods</p>
              <p class="spaced-text"> </p>
              <p class="Introductionwithshi">I love exploring the city since I just came from our province called
                Ilocos Sur.</p> 
                <p class="spaced-text"> </p>
                <p class="Introductionwithshi"> I wasn't always this "shy" type person, I was always loud, confident,cocky, attention seeker
                    type of person, I used to be cool until certain things humbled me, I got bullied, got ignored, got heartbroken, got hated by people
                    I mostly knew and mostly, I got overlooked</p>
                    <p class="Introductionwithshi">I was depressed..then quarantine came along, I got more depressed, sure I got
                    more connected to my family but they didn't like the new hobby I'm doing, which is gaming, because I can't go outside to play
                    basketball at that time because of the lockdown era, I knew gaming was bad for my health and my family kept reminding me but I never 
                    listened, so in short I was this disgusting looking ahh gamer, but suddenly at the right time before pandemic ended
                    ,it hit me,</p> 
                    <p class="Introductionwithshi"> I realized everything I've been doing is actually worse than just bad, staying up late nor never sleeping at actually
                    and I never ate that much and I always tend to wake up late and ignore my schoolworks and chores, after the pandemic, I started
                    to change, bit by bit, It started baad, because I was so bad at communicating to people due because of the lockdown that I didn't '
                    interact with anyone outside at all,</p>
                    <p class="Introductionwithshi">During that time I was starting to love Basketball again and dreamt of having an 
                    actual chance of becoming a professional and during that time I'm also aware of my insecurities and that's what keeps destroying my 
                    confidence until now, but I'm better now, </p>
                    <p class="Introductionwithshi">I'm actaully changing' I've been socializing alot and prioritizing my chores and schoolworks
                    and ofcoure having time with my girlfriend, what I'm trying to say is life will humble you, or should I say GOD will humble you
                    like he did to me, and if u follow Jesus Christ's words, it'll change u to become a better person than before.
                </p>
                <p class="spaced-text"> </p>
                <p class="Introductionwithshi">My main goals are making my parents proud,being a better person and 
                having a successful life </p>
